Our idea is to tell the other drivers which are having the same route about the fog conditions, road friction so that driver will be prepared for it in advance. On more add-on in our idea is to install an alcohol detection system in the car. If a driver is very drunk above the allowed BAC index of 0.08% then the car will automatically not ignite the engine and alert the driver to “not to drive this time as you are very drunk” through a voice note. <br/>
