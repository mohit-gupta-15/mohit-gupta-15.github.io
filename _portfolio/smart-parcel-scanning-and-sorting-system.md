This proposal is a fine blend of IoT and Artificial Intelligence in effectively solving the real-time problem.<br/>
Making use of this system with some standard improvements will reduce time and man power in scanning and sorting of parcels. Using the web interface to gain a real-time parcel tracking and managing the sensors, will greatly increase the performance, feedback and profit of the organization. Our model has higher accuracy, precision than previously
stated model in the table below. <br/><br/>
