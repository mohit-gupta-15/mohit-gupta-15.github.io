Hello folks, I’m back with a new article. This article is a bit interesting and knowledgeable as you can see in the title as well. This article can be very useful for you during your databases interviews and exams. This topics were asked in my interview, and in some of them, I’m blank at that moment XD. Then, I learn about these concepts and find them very interesting. <br/>
In this article, I’ll be discussing about some of the powerful functions of the postgreSQL, which can help you in solving mathematical queries in your interviews and exams. With this, I’ll be discussing some questions as well so that you can understand where we can use these functions properly.<br/>
