Hey geeks! Hope you are doing well. From the title of this article, you will understand what we are talking about in this article. So in this article, we will be learning how easy can be to build a RESTFUL API, integrated with a PostgreSQL server. I learned it when one of my friends needs a secure interface for sending the sensor data from the hardware to the SQL server. He asked me, is there was any way I can send the data directly to the server? So, the first time I worked with SQL & NodeJs. Because in most of the cases Nodejs is combined with NoSQL servers like Mongo DB.
