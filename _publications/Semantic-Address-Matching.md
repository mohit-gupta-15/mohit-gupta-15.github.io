**Abstract**

Address matching is an important task for many businesses especially delivery and take out companies which help them to take out a certain address from their data warehouse. Existing solution uses similarity of strings, and edit distance algorithms to find out the similar addresses from the address database, but these algorithms could not work effectively with redundant, unstructured, or incomplete address data. This paper discuss semantic Address matching technique, by which we can find out a particular address from a list of possible addresses. We have also reviewed existing practices and their shortcoming. Semantic address matching is an essentially NLP task in the field of deep learning. Through this technique We have the ability to triumph the drawbacks of existing methods like redundant or abbreviated data problems. The solution uses the OCR on invoices to extract the address and create the data pool of addresses. Then this data is fed to the algorithm BM-25 for scoring the best matching entries. Then to observe the best result, this will pass through BERT for giving the best possible result from the similar queries. Our investigation exhibits that our methodology enormously improves both accuracy and review of cutting-edge technology existing techniques.
